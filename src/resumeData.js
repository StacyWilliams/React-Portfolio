    "aboutme":"I am passionate about stepping into an industry where I will be able to contribute by building useful software products for the world. I took an interest in web development in 2007 while attending college. In 2009, I received an Associate Degree in Computer Information Systems and a Technical Certificate in Computer Networking where I gained exposure to programming in Visual Basic, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, and Java. I had to leave college 5 classes short of my B.S degree.  But in April 2019 I continued my journey as a Computer Science student online at Lambda School with a focus in Full Stack Web Development. In my courses, I have gained hands-on, real world experience as a Software Developer that includes learning in a remote collaborative environment, completing sprint projects each week, practicing modern technology standard and completing a collaborative 8 week project through multiple development cycles. My goal is to work in a Full Time role as a Software Engineer and bring together my love for technology and my curiosity of the world as a whole. I love to learn and I'm always working to refine my knowledge as a professional but also personally.",
